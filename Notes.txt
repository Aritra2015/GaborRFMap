1. Include option to change the temporal frequency in the mapping stimuli.
2. Include option to convert a gabor to a grating.
3. At present doneList in GRFMapStimTable is maintained as a 6-D array with kMaxMapValues = 8 entires per dimension, which needs 8^6 bytes. If fewer number of entries are used per parameter (say numAzi=1), we are unnecessarily dealing with a large and sparse matrix. Instead, this list should be constructed dynamically (numAzi*numEle*numSigma*numSF*numOri*numCon*numTF). This will allow us to increase the number of possible entries (kMaxMapValues) as long as all the entries are not large simultaneously.
4. Put digital codes for each stimulus so that the entire mapping sequence (one side) can be reconstructed from the data stream directly.
5. If percentage of catch stimuli is set to 100% and the actual task Gabor contrast is set at 0%, this essentially becomes a fixation task. Allow an option to run the program in this mode (need to count the catch stimuli in the done list).

The code gives computer errors if contrast is different from 100%.
